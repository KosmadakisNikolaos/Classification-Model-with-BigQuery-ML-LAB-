# Classification-Model-with-BigQuery-ML-LAB-

I will be using ecommerce data from the real Google Ecommerce storefront: https://shop.googlemerchandisestore.com/.
Their visitor and order data has been loaded into BigQuery and i am going to 
build a machine learning model to predict whether a visitor will return for more purchases later.



- ### Tasks :
    - Use BigQuery to find public datasets
    - Query and explore the ecommerce dataset
    - Create a training and evaluation dataset to be used for batch prediction
    - Create a classification (logistic regression) model in BQML
    - Evaluate the performance of your machine learning model
    - Predict and rank the probability that a visitor will make a purchase
    
    
 ### Model Accuracy
